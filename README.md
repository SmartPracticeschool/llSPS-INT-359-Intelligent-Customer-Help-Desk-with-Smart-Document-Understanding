Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding

# Overview of the Project
A customer helpdesk chatbot is created for Ecobee3. Ecobee3 is a smart thermostat falling under the category of smart home
devices. The chatbot helps the user to gather information by raising query. This chatbot accesses an unstructured document (user
manual) of Ecobee3, by smart understanding of the document it replies to any query related to Ecobee3. We use Smart
Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train the chatbot to give responses from User Guide when a question is
asked about the operation of the device and lies beyond the scope of the chatbot.
